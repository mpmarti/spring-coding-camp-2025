# April 22: reading and writing files
=====================================

In this exercise, we will read a file and print some output. Then, we'll write a new file by modifying that input. 

**Context:** the file we will be working with, `ex1.txt`, has names and scores (from 1 to 10) of a test. Anyone with a test score less than 3 has failed the test (sad). Your objective will be to:

1. Read the text file using Python scripts.
2. Having read the file, define who passed and who failed the test.
3. Write a new text file with a new column that says whether that person has failed (`fail`) or passed (`pass`) the test.

At the end of this excercise, you should have produced 3 new files:

- `Notebook.ipynb`, a notebook where you'll work on your results.
- `utils.py`, a Python script that has the functions necessary to do the work.
